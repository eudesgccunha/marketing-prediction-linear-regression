Linear regression prediction model for marketing team.

A company is investing monthly in online advertising platforms such as YouTube, Facebook and newspapers to prospect for leads. All records of money spent on advertising and all sales returns generated from these investments have been recorded.

To better understand the relationship between the variables present in these records and identify the factors that most impact lead generation, the company requested an analysis of the data.

In addition, the company's sponsor wants to create a value prediction model to estimate the sales return that can be generated from a given investment in advertising.
